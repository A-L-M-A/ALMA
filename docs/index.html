<h1>Welcome to ALMA Help</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
ALMA is a computational model of affect that integrates the most common
affective phenomena, which can be observed in humans. Based on a kind of
cognitive appraisal different affect types are simulated in a hierarchical 
generation process. Hence, the name ALMA, which stands for <b>A</b> 
<b>L</b>ayered <b>M</b>odel of <b>A</b>ffect.<br> 


<h2>Background</h2>
The ALMA web page http://www.dfki.de/~gebhard/alma/ provides comprehensive 
scientific background information.<br><br>

ALMA provides a real-time simulation of emotions, moods
and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect.
The use of this model consists of two phases:
<ul>
   <li>In the <i>preparation
    phase</i> appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must
    be specified in AML format - a XML based affect modeling
    language. The graphical CharacterBuilder tool provides menu-based interfaces.</li>
   <li>In the <i>run-time</i> phase, the specified appraisal rules are
    used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a
    subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective
    characteristics are represented in AML and can be processed
    by sub-sequent modules that control cognitive processes and
    physical behavior of embodied conversational characters.</li>
 </ul>
