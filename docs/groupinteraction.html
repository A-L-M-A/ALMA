The representation of groups allows a simulation of on-going dialog interaction
between each character and also a simulation of a meta-level group affect. The
latter is work in progress. The approach is, that a group can be seen as a
virtual character. A group has no personality. There is some evidence in 
social science research, that a group <i>borrow</i> the personality of the 
acting/leading group member. The appraisal and the computation of affect and 
its specification is similar to the computation known from characters.
<br><br>
With the help of the InteractionRecorder an ongoing dialog between characters
can be observed at the level of Dialog Acts and character based appraisal.

<br><br>
The InteractionRecorder records Dialog Act Tag and Appraisal Tag input in a
sequential way. The result is an AffectScript that consists of these tags. 
AffectScripts can be replayed in order to inspect the influence of the 
input items on the characters' affect.
<br><br>
AffectScripts can be created manually. A right-click on a character
in the character wheel on the left side of the InteractionRecorder brings up
a menu with the different input types and commands.
<br><br>
There are 2 commands: <i>Reset Character</i> and <i>Context</i>. 
<I>Reset Character</i> resets a characters affective state to the defined
default values. All elicited emotions will be removed.<br>
The <i>Context</i> command lets the author add some comments about the situation.
<br><br>
Each item of an AffectScript can be edited or deleted. A right-click on the 
desired item brings up a menu.
