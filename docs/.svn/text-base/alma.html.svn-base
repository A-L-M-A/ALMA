<b>Introduction</b><br>
Alma is a computational model for the simulation of three basic affect characteristics that human beings can experience. These are emotions, moods, and personality. As it is observable in all-days life, the different affect characteristics are interferring in some way. Based on a kind of cognitve appraisal different affect characteristics are simulated in a hierachical generation process. Hence, the name alma, which stands for <b>a</b> <b>l</b>ayered <b>m</b>odel of <b>a</b>ffect.<br>

<br><b>Background</b><br>
Alma integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective characteristics are represented in AffectML and can be processed by sub-sequent modules that control cognitive processes and physical behavior of embodied conversational characters.<br>

<br><b>Software</b><br>
Alma is designed to be integrated in a software system.<br>

<br><b>Interfaces</b><br>

<br><b>Projects</b><br>
Alma is used in the the VirtualHuman project. It's aim is the developpment of interactive virtual characters that serve as dialog partners with human-like conversational skills. Alma provides our virtual humans with a personality profile and with real-time emotions and moods. These are used by the multimodal behavior generation module to enrich the lifelike and believable qualities.
